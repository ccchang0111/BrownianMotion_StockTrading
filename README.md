Einstein's _Brownian Motion theory_ in analyzing stock's momentum.

I believe Einstien's Brownian Motion theory is the most accurate and most scientific way of assessing **_momentum_** in anything (Stock Price for instance). This was my side-project during my PhD while I was using Brownian Motion to look at protein motion on the neuronal cell membrane. Those protein motions can be categorized into three groups and same as the stock prices: 

1.  Direct Motion (great momentum, either up or down)
2.  Random Motion (wondering around)
3.  Restricted Motion (negative momentum, not growing or dropping as fast as before)

This simulation is just for FUN. And I am **not a millionaire**... your call
